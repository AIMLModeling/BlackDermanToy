# BlackDermanToy
Black, Derman, and Toy model is an early no-arbitrage model published in 1990. This model has the advantage that it can easily be represented in the form of a binomial tree. John Hull wrote his method for building the bionomial tree and I demonstrated how to implement this method in Python.  https://youtu.be/uofIcl_wQwc
